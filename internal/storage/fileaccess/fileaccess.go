// Package fileaccess decides who a file token is for, what it allows and how
// long it lasts.
//
// Callers outside the server never see a stored file's value, only a token
// for it. A token names its holder (a user by IdP subject, a machine client by
// client ID) and lists its scopes, the actions it allows:
//
//   - ScopeRead: open the file on the storage route.
//   - ScopeSubmit: send the token back as a file field's value in a task
//     submission, where it resolves to the stored value.
//
// A user's token that can read expires after the configured lifetime. One that
// can only be submitted opens nothing, so it never expires. A machine client's
// token never expires either, because an OGA keeps it in its own records for as
// long as it needs the file.
//
// Tokens are grants. Resolve checks only that the caller is the token's
// holder, that the token allows what the caller is doing and, if it expires,
// that it hasn't; it doesn't check again whether the caller may still see the
// file. So issue a token only to a caller already allowed what its scopes
// allow. A caller who loses that access keeps it until their tokens expire:
// for a user, after the configured lifetime; otherwise, once the key that
// sealed them is retired.
//
// filetoken seals and opens the tokens. This package only binds them to
// callers.
