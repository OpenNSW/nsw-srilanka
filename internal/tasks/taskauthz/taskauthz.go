// Package taskauthz is the shared vocabulary of task authorization: who the
// caller is, what the deployment's logical principal names mean, and which roles
// the caller may act in on a given task.
//
// It holds no policy. Three packages build on it, and none of them depends on
// another:
//
//   - internal/tasks/authzgate — Layer 1. An HTTP middleware that resolves the
//     caller's identity into an Input and attaches it to the request context,
//     along with a lazy ownership resolver.
//   - internal/tasks/extensions/authz — Layer 2 for writes. A PRE_RESUME task
//     extension deciding whether the caller may run a command on a task.
//   - internal/tasks/readauthz — Layer 2 for reads. Decides whether the caller may
//     read a task at all.
//
// These types used to live in the write extension. But only one of the packages
// that need them is a core task extension, so the shared half cannot live under
// extensions/ without Layer 1 and the read evaluator importing a write-policy
// package for types that have nothing to do with write policy. Eligibility is
// here for the same reason: both Layer-2 evaluators rest on that one rule, and a
// security rule with two implementations can drift.
