// Eligibility answers, for one caller and one task, which logical roles that
// caller may act in.

// company owns the task's consignment in that same role. Holding the role is not
// enough: a user with only a Trader token, at a company that happens to sit in
// some consignment's CHA slot, may not act as its CHA. Both task authorization
// paths rest on this rule, which is why it is computed in exactly one place.

// roles match none of them — the common denial — is answered from the token
// alone. A client principal, or a user with no ownership resolver attached, is
// eligible for nothing; both are reported as such rather than as an error, so the
// decision stays with the policy layer that knows what a denial means.
